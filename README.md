<h2>Spotify App Guide</h2>
<a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> is a streaming music service that pays artists royalties and uses 
Facebook accounts for login. It has free (Ad-supported) or paid models, and has good integration and design 
docs, which are avaialble at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/

However, it's difficult to find a good guide to building anything but the most basic app, so I put together
this three-part guide with working code demos, which walk you through building an app that displays playlists,
albums, and a song-of-the-day carousel.
